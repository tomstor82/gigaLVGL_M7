Arduino script for managing 2 heater relays, 1 water boiler relay and 1 inverter start relay. Utilises 4 DHT22 sensors for thermostatic control and CANBUS communication with BMS.

There are comprehensive coding to manage a daxtromn inverter through relay and solar input relay control as the inverter lacks many sought features found on higher end brands.

CANBUS is used for communication to and from the Orion JR 2 BMS which protects a Li battery bank, as well as clearing fault messages that appears.

The lvgl script includes 3 external fonts libraries for required fonts only, to keep size down, utilises touch buttons and data graphics to show required information at a glance.
More information is found in message boxes that pop up on touching specific items.
